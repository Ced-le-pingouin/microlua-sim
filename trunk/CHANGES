0.5 beta 1 (6 April 2011)
-------------------------
Changes for users:
* add the fake_root option, which will allow emulating SD card root by replacing
  the initial "/" in absolute paths with the "fake root" directory on your
  machine. By default, it is ./sdcard in MLS directory
* as an addition to the above feature, "fat:/" paths are now supported
  (I suppose they're mostly used in older scripts anyway)
* it is now possible to disable "libs emulation", i.e. remove the libs and 
  functions made available by the default ML shell/libs. So you can test the 
  shell or write your own and test it with MLS
* it is now possible to choose a boot script (=shell) that will automatically
  start if you don't provide a script name on the command line. By default, it
  is /lua/libs/libs.lua, just like in ML. If you use the "fake root" described
  above, you should put the libs in <fake root>/lua/libs/libs.lua
* Sprite: start/stop/resetAnimation() are implemented (finally!)
* Image: mirrorH() and mirrorV() behavior was incorrect
* Canvas: X2 and Y2 handling was wrong in most functions
* OpenGL: screen.drawGradientRect() clipping was wrong
* OpenGL: screen.drawTextBox() clipping was buggy
* OpenGL: fixed many transparency issues
* OpenGL: Canvas.newPoint() no longer crashes
* OpenGL: ScrollMap is faster (when setTile() is not used, at least)
* wx: ScrollMap.draw() didn't repeat correctly 
* wx: Canvas.newPoint() didn't work on the lower screen
* wx: screen.drawGradientRect() didn't work when x0 > x1 or y0 > y1
* wx: screen.drawGradientRect() crashed with some Color parameters
* System: listDirectory() now puts "." and ".." before other items
* reloading a script from disk would sometimes crash
* log and error messages containing long paths are more readable
* boolean options in config were sometimes read incorrectly

Changes for the developer:
* Libs emulation facts:
  - some modules have a different name when libs emulation is disabled: 
    Controls => ds_controls, System => ds_system
  - Timer, Debug, DateTime, Sprite and INI are not defined when libs emulation 
    is disabled (in ML, they're defined by the default shell/libs)
  - some "internal" functions, undocumented for users, are available (in screen,
    ds_system, ds_controls...)
* Class: inheritance support is faster. And comes in two versions: "local" 
  (the default) and "global" classes
* Canvas: ATTR_ constants have the same values as in ML
* screen: SCREEN_UP and SCREEN_DOWN constants have the same values as in ML
* compile scripts: new version written in Lua (make and package don't use it 
  yet, though)
* compile scripts: it is now possible to keep debug symbols when compiling with
  Lua AIO
* compile scripts: class names in compiled version are less likely to clash with
  global variables in user scripts

0.4 (2 March 2010)
------------------
  ! OpenGL is now the default display mode in mls.ini
  * OpenGL fixes: no more white rectangles instead of images, or garbled images,
    or unbearably low FPS (on older GPUs that switched to software rendering)
    If you still have problems with OpenGL, notably with Pause, take a look at
    mls.ini, there are additional options for OpenGL
  * screen.drawTextBox() now supports newlines
  * new "key bindings" dialog in Help menu (or Ctrl+K)
  * zoom: fix cases where the zoom factor wouldn't switch back to 1x
  * zoom: disable zoom change while in fullscreen mode
  * mls.ini config file is provided instead of mls.ini.dist (which had to be 
    renamed by the user)

0.4 beta 3 (21 February 2010)
-----------------------------
  * OpenGL support. It can be enabled in the config file
  * the main window can now be resized, and a shortcut key (F7) allows you to 
    switch between 1x and 2x zoom. On Windows, F11 enables/disables fullscreen 
    (a bit ugly because of the non integer zoom ratio).
    WARNING: resizing the window can cause massive slowdown if OpenGL is 
    disabled (except maybe on Windows)
  * it is now possible to reload a script from disk (Shift+B)
  * initial current working directory is now the same as the running script
  * shortcut keys: increasing/decreasing FPS/UPS now uses steps of 5, instead of
    1
  * shortcut keys: displaying and hiding the console is now bound to F12 instead
    of F5
  * arrow keys now work on Windows too
  * screen: drawGradientRect() accuracy can now be adjusted (F5 key and config 
    file option). This option does nothing in OpenGL mode
  * screen: it is now possible to enable or disable "rectangle length 
    correction" (F6 key and config file option). This option does nothing in 
    OpenGL mode
  * screen.drawTextBox() is now correctly clipped when overflowing from the 
    upper screen to the lower one
  * module() and require() should work better in loaded scripts
  * Font.print(): in ML, the color argument is ignored (bug). This behaviour is
    now reproduced by MLS
  * Image.load() now only accepts png/gif/jpg/jpeg files
  * newPress behaviour can mimic either ML2 or ML3 (H key and config file 
    option)
  * Image.blit(): MLS reproduces the "weird" behaviour of ML when a rotation is
    set on the image (offset or not when displaying)
  * variable accesses like _G["var_name"] didn't work in previous versions
  * default UPS in the provided config file are now set to 60 instead of 55
  * timing handling has been changed (but I'm not quite happy with it right now
    :( )
    
0.4 beta 2 (9 August 2009)
--------------------------
  * Stylus: doubleClick has been implemented, released behaviour is now 
    similar to the one in Micro Lua, and newPress can behave as in ML2 or ML3
  * screen.mirrorH()/mirrorV(): they are now enabled, because we discovered 
    that they really were enabled in ML, only they needed a second 
    (undocumented) boolean parameter set to true to have any effect
  * ScrollMap: getTile()/setTile() are now implemented, and scrollmap 
    transparency is now respected
  * screen: functions drawing a rectangle now draw it correctly (they used to
    draw rectangles one pixel shorter than they should have been)
  * enabled an internal hack that detects whether the StylusBox library is 
    loading, and replace its newPressinBox() function with our own version, 
    because the original one doesn't work in MLS (nor in ML3)
  * state of current script (paused etc.) is now displayed in a colored box, 
    directly on the DS screen, in addition to the status bar, where it wasn't 
    too noticeable
  * shortcut to erase the content of the console (Del key)
  * the console is automatically displayed on error
  * whenever an error occurs while loading an image, the error message is no 
    longer displayed in an alert dialog box, it's displayed in the console
  * more detailed error messages (the call stack is displayed)
  * "*.*" filter available in File open dialog. It allows Linux users to see
    "*.LUA" files, which are different, on Linux, than "*.lua" files
  * Windows: mls and mls-src don't crash when you specify the path of a script
    that contains spaces on the command line
  * Windows: the launcher file is now a (fake) .exe instead of a .bat, which 
    allows us to embed an icon in it
  * Linux: folders and files with incorrect case in dofile(), Image.load() etc.
    are now always found if they exist (e.g. trying to load "LIBWindow.lua" when
    the file name is "libWindow.lua")

0.4 beta 1 (2 August 2009)
--------------------------
  ! Micro Lua Simulator is now licenced under GPL v3. This means you get the 
    source, and you can modify it, BUT you have to provide the modified source
    whenever you decide to re-distribute your work
  * compatible with the new Micro Lua version, 3.0:
    - Image.scale() works as it should, i.e. it doesn't reset itself after a 
      blit()
    - new variable: MICROLUA_VERSION
    - new functions: render(), Font.getStringWidth()
    - new classes/objects:
      . Rumble (right now it's seen as always inserted, but does nothing 
        visible)
      . Motion (considered missing, the various measure functions return 0)
      . DateTime
      . Wifi (but no UDP sockets)
      . Sound (a stub)
  * bitmap fonts (read: MicroLua-correct), but slower (and latin-1 only)
  * GUI and menus: you can load scripts from there, and you don't have to 
    provide the name of the initial script at the command line anymore
  * some key bindings allowing to change FPS/UPS, pause and restart scripts...
  * also added the keypad numbers for up/down/left/right moves
  * all new console that displays the errors encountered in scripts, instead
    of violently exiting MLS. MLS log/debug messages also appear there
  * no more screen flickering in Windows (at least not on my side)
  * the sim now reads some options from a config file
  * scripts and their additional files (images, libs...) don't have to sit in 
    MLS root anymore to be found
  * semi case-insensitive file loading for non-Windows systems (different 
    uppercase/lowercase combinations tried for the name and extension)

0.3 (11 March 2009)
-------------------
  * Mac version officially released. It seems slower than Linux/Windows versions
    as far as unlimited FPS average are concerned, but it can achieve 60fps in 
    Seaquest, so I guess it's not a problem right now
  * bash/batch scripts to launch the sim more easily
  * many graphics optimisations for "simple" images, i.e. sprites and 
    non-transformed images (no tint/scale/rotate) => in the Seaquest remake demo
    mode, I noticed a 350+% FPS increase on Linux, and a whopping 1700+% on 
    Windows! (of course, for optimisation measurement, I temporarily removed FPS
    limit to get these)
  * "display" FPS are limited to 60, and "internal" FPS (main loop) to 55
    (although the real achieved FPS may vary slightly depending on the OS, from 
    50 to 60+)
  * in addition to the existing key bindings, I put back the arrow keys for 
    up/down/left/right, because these seem to work well on Linux and Mac.
    Also, to eliminate differences between AZERTY and QWERTY keyboard layouts, 
    R/T can now be used as L/R, and F/V as Start/Select
  * README and CHANGES are now also available in french

0.2 (22 February 2009)
----------------------
  * Windows version now works, yeah! (though slowly, and not thoroughly tested)
  * internal change: the main loop is no longer executed in the main process, it
    is in a Lua coroutine. This is my first try, and this change was made for 
    the Windows version. It seems to work in Linux too, so all is ok for now
  * changed key bindings: up/down/left/right are now the I/K/J/L keys, and 
    Start/Select = Q/W. These changes were made because wxWidgets for Windows 
    doesn't seem to detect key presses on arrows on my laptop, and the key codes
    for "&" and "é" (Start/Select in version 0.1) were different than Linux

0.1 (18 February 2009)
----------------------
  * initial release
  * doesn't work under Windows at the moment, for unknown reasons
  * sound doesn't crash the scripts but is not heard
  * font system not correct
  * some methods and behaviours of ML DS not implemented yet
  * all scripts are limited to 30FPS (even "internal" frames, not only display)
  * a bit slow

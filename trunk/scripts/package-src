## go to MLS root dir (doesn't work if script was started from PATH)
OLD_DIR=$PWD
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname $0)
cd $SCRIPT_DIR/..

VERSION=`cat VERSION`
DEST_DIR="mls-$VERSION-src"
ARCHIVE_NAME="$DEST_DIR.zip"

# this command copies the working copy to another location, without copying non
# version-controlled files, but keeping local changes. Here we copy to a temp
# dir
svn export . $DEST_DIR

# delete any previous archive with the same name
rm -f $ARCHIVE_NAME
# create the new archive
zip -r $ARCHIVE_NAME $DEST_DIR
# remove temp dir used to create the archive
rm -fR $DEST_DIR

## back to original dir
cd $OLD_DIR

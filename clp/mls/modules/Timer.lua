-- Micro Lua Timer module simulation, based on wxWidgets.
--
-- NOTE: Since MLS needs a timer internally, but the Timer module could be 
-- disabled (no libs emulation), there's a clp.mls.Timer that reproduces exactly
-- the ML Timer module API, so for the present class we simply use inheritance.
--
-- @class module
-- @name clp.mls.modules.Timer
-- @author Ced-le-pingouin <Ced.le.pingouin@gmail.com>
-- @see clp.mls.Timer

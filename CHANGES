0.4 (?? ??? 2009)
-----------------
  ! Micro Lua Simulator is now licenced under GPL v3. This means you get the 
    source, and you can modify it, BUT you have to provide the modified source
    whenever you decide to re-distribute your work
  * compatible with the new Micro Lua version, 3.0:
    - Image.scale() works as it should, i.e. it doesn't reset itself after a 
      blit()
    - new variable: MICROLUA_VERSION
    - new functions: render(), Font.getStringWidth()
    - new classes/objects:
      . Rumble (right now it's seen as always inserted, but does nothing 
        visible)
      . Motion (considered missing, the various measure functions return 0)
      . DateTime
      . Wifi (but no UDP sockets)
      . Sound (a stub)
  * bitmap fonts (read: MicroLua-correct), but slower (and latin-1 only)
  * Stylus: doubleClick has been implemented, and released behaviour is now 
    similar to the one in Micro Lua
  * screen.mirrorH()/mirrorV(): they are now enabled, because we discovered 
    that they really were enabled in ML, only they needed a second 
    (undocumented) boolean parameter set to true to have any effect
  * screen: functions drawing a rectangle now draw it correctly (they used to
    draw rectangles one pixel shorter than they should have been)
  * ScrollMap: getTile()/setTile() are now implemented, and scrollmap 
    transparency is now respected
  * enabled an internal hack that detects whether the StylusBox library is 
    loading, and replace its newPressinBox() function with our own version, 
    because the original one doesn't work in MLS (nor in ML3)
  * GUI and menus: you can load scripts from there, and you don't have to 
    provide the name of the initial script at the command line anymore
  * some key bindings allowing to change FPS/UPS, pause and restart scripts...
  * also added the keypad numbers for up/down/left/right moves
  * all new console that displays the errors encountered in scripts, instead
    of violently exiting MLS. MLS log/debug messages also appear there
  * no more screen flickering in Windows (at least not on my side)
  * the launcher file is now a (fake) .exe in Windows instead of a .bat, which 
    allows us to embed an icon in it
  * the sim now reads some options from a config file
  * scripts and their additional files (images, libs...) don't have to sit in 
    MLS root anymore to be found
  * semi case-insensitive file loading for non-Windows systems (different 
    uppercase/lowercase combinations tried for the name and extension)

0.3 (11 March 2009)
-------------------
  * Mac version officially released. It seems slower than Linux/Windows versions
    as far as unlimited FPS average are concerned, but it can achieve 60fps in 
    Seaquest, so I guess it's not a problem right now
  * bash/batch scripts to launch the sim more easily
  * many graphics optimisations for "simple" images, i.e. sprites and 
    non-transformed images (no tint/scale/rotate) => in the Seaquest remake demo
    mode, I noticed a 350+% FPS increase on Linux, and a whopping 1700+% on 
    Windows! (of course, for optimisation measurement, I temporarily removed FPS
    limit to get these)
  * "display" FPS are limited to 60, and "internal" FPS (main loop) to 55
    (although the real achieved FPS may vary slightly depending on the OS, from 
    50 to 60+)
  * in addition to the existing key bindings, I put back the arrow keys for 
    up/down/left/right, because these seem to work well on Linux and Mac.
    Also, to eliminate differences between AZERTY and QWERTY keyboard layouts, 
    R/T can now be used as L/R, and F/V as Start/Select
  * README and CHANGES are now also available in french

0.2 (22 February 2009)
----------------------
  * Windows version now works, yeah! (though slowly, and not thoroughly tested)
  * internal change: the main loop is no longer executed in the main process, it
    is in a Lua coroutine. This is my first try, and this change was made for 
    the Windows version. It seems to work in Linux too, so all is ok for now
  * changed key bindings: up/down/left/right are now the I/K/J/L keys, and 
    Start/Select = Q/W. These changes were made because wxWidgets for Windows 
    doesn't seem to detect key presses on arrows on my laptop, and the key codes
    for "&" and "Ã©" (Start/Select in version 0.1) were different than Linux

0.1 (18 February 2009)
----------------------
  * initial release
  * doesn't work under Windows at the moment, for unknown reasons
  * sound doesn't crash the scripts but is not heard
  * font system not correct
  * some methods and behaviours of ML DS not implemented yet
  * all scripts are limited to 30FPS (even "internal" frames, not only display)
  * a bit slow
